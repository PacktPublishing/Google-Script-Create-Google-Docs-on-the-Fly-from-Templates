## About the Video Course
This course will walk you through how to set up a Google Docs generator using Google Docs as a template and storing the data in Google Sheets. The source code is included so you can get started quickly, and includes all the methods and classes used for this type of project (they can also be used for similar custom applications). Google spreadsheets are used as a data source. The focus of this course is on how to use Google Script to create Google Docs on the fly. In the course, Google Sheets is used as a data source to list created documents and templates, storing the doc ID and other important data so that they can then be referenced to link to the Google document that was created. This course is designed to illustrate what can be done with Google Script and how it can be used to create applications that do a lot. Google Script is JavaScript with a bunch of Google predefined classes and methods. It gives you the ability to connect apps together. The focus of this course is on Google Script and frontend coding such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery (which will not be covered in detail).
